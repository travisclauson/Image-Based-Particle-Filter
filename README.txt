To change the experience, a multitude of variables can be changed: Line 11- droneSpeed – number of distance units to move at each time stepLine 12/13 – resampling/drone movement noise – to change the uncertainty of the simulationLine 20 – displayMap – set to true to see the algorithm step through, false to collect simulation data. Line 25 – fixedMap – to change the environment/map for the simulation
